        <h3 style = "text-align: center;">Averting a possible nuclear war at the peak of the cold war:</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 1em;">The record on how close humanity came to a full-blown nuclear war is
            insufficiently  recognized, historians thought that a full
            blown nuclear war during the 1980’s cold war between the United States and 
            the Soviet Union could have wiped out the northern hemisphere, but new studies
            show that it was  in fact much more dangerous than that. 
            In 1983 during the war crises, Russia automated early warning systems detected
            an incoming missile strike From the United States, sending the highest-level alert.
            The protocol for Russian military was to retaliate immediately with a nuclear attack on its own. 
            There was an officer, who decided to disobey 
            the orders and not report the warnings.
            Stanislav Petrov was a lieutenant colonel 
            in the Soviet air defence forces and duty officer 
            at Serpukhov-15, he decided to report 
            the alert as a system malfunction.</p>
            <p><em>“I had a funny feeling in my gut,”</em> he told the Washington Post in 1999,
            <em>“I didn’t want to make a  mistake. I made a decision, and that was it.”</em></p>
